# vSolve: An Extractive Question Answering System

Recent advances in the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP) have led to the development of
intelligent model machines that can understand natural language. An extractive Question Answering (QA) system
retrieves relevant information from the textual context provided to answer questions asked by users. The objective of
this paper is to leverage DeBERTa, a transformer-based deep learning model with self-attention mechanisms and
advanced pretraining techniques. The following extractive question answering system accurately captures the context
of the text. Our system uses the SQuAD dataset, a popular benchmark dataset for evaluating QA systems. This application
also demonstrates the usefulness of DeBERTa and SQuAD datasets in training extractive QA systems.
